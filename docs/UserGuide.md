## 1. Introduction

RLAD is a lightweight, terminal-native personal finance tracker built for users who prefer typed commands over spreadsheets and GUIs. It is designed for speed, precision, and portability — if you can open a terminal, you can use RLAD.

**Core capabilities:**

| Capability          | Description                                                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transaction logging | Record credits (income) and debits (expenses) with full metadata  |
| Filtering & sorting | Query your history by type, category, date range, and amount range|
| Budget tracking     | Set monthly spending budgets per category and monitor usage        |
| CSV I/O             | Export data for Excel/Sheets; import from CSV backups              |
| Persistent storage  | Data is saved automatically after every change                     |

RLAD is designed for NUS students and young professionals who are comfortable in the terminal and want a no-overhead tool to stay on top of their personal finances.

> **Prerequisite:** Java 17 or above must be installed and accessible from your terminal (`java --version` to verify).

## 4. Command Reference

> **Notation:** `<param>` = required. `[param]` = optional.

---

### 4.1 `add` — Record a Transaction

Records a new credit or debit transaction. The first three parameters are mandatory; category and description are optional.

**Syntax:**
```
add <type> <amount> <date> [category] [description]
```

**Parameters:**

| Position | Parameter     | Required | Accepted Values                                                |
|----------|---------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | `type`        | ✅ Yes    | `credit` or `debit`                                            |
| 2        | `amount`      | ✅ Yes    | Positive number, up to 2 decimal places (e.g. `15.50`, `3000`) |
| 3        | `date`        | ✅ Yes    | `YYYY-MM-DD` format                                            |
| 4        | `category`    | ❌ No     | Single word (e.g. `food`, `salary`, `transport`)               |
| 5        | `description` | ❌ No     | Free text; use quotes for multiple words (e.g. `"Chicken rice"`) |

**Examples:**
```
add credit 3000 2026-03-01 salary "March salary"
add debit 15.50 2026-03-05 food "Chicken rice"
add debit 5.00 2026-03-06
add credit 500 2026-03-10 freelance
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Transaction added successfully!
   ID: a7b2c3
   CREDIT: $3000.00 on 2026-03-01
   Category: salary
   Description: "March salary"
```

> **Note:** Each transaction is assigned a unique 6-character **HashID** upon creation.
> This ID is required for `delete` and `modify` — note it down, or retrieve it later with `list`.

---

### 4.2 `delete` — Remove a Transaction

Permanently removes a single transaction identified by its HashID.

**Syntax:**
```
delete <hashID>
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Description                                                  |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `hashID`  | ✅ Yes    | The 6-character ID assigned when the transaction was created |

**Example:**
```
delete a7b2c3
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Transaction deleted successfully!
   ID: a7b2c3
   Deleted: [a7b2c3] DEBIT | 2026-03-05 | $15.50 | food | Chicken rice at Clementi
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Deletion is **permanent** and cannot be undone. Use `list` to verify the HashID before deleting.

---

### 4.3 `modify` — Edit a Transaction

Updates one or more fields of an existing transaction. The HashID is required; at least one field to update must be specified.

**Syntax:**
```
modify <hashID> [field=value ...]
```

**Modifiable fields:**

| Field         | Example value           |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| `type`        | `credit` or `debit`     |
| `amount`      | `25.00`                 |
| `date`        | `2026-03-10`            |
| `category`    | `transport`             |
| `description` | `"Updated description"` |

**Examples:**
```
# Update only the amount
modify a7b2c3 amount=25.00

# Update amount and description together
modify a7b2c3 amount=20.00 description="Fancy chicken rice"

# Update category and date together
modify a7b2c3 category=transport date=2026-03-06
```

> **Note:** Fields not specified in the command remain unchanged.

---

### 4.4 `list` — View Transactions

Displays your transaction history. Without any filters, all transactions are shown in the current sort order.

**Syntax:**
```
list [filter:value ...]
```

**Available filters:**

| Filter  | Example                | Description                                                       |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type:` | `list type:debit`      | Show only debits or only credits                                  |
| `cat:`  | `list cat:food`        | Filter by category (use commas for multiple: `cat:food,transport`) |
| `from:` | `list from:2026-03-01` | Show transactions on or after this date                           |
| `to:`   | `list to:2026-03-31`   | Show transactions on or before this date                          |
| `min:`  | `list min:50`          | Show transactions with amount ≥ this value                        |
| `max:`  | `list max:100`         | Show transactions with amount ≤ this value                        |

**Examples:**
```
list                                     # Show all transactions
list type:debit                          # Show only expenses
list cat:food                            # Show food-related transactions
list from:2026-03-01 to:2026-03-31       # Show transactions in March 2026
list min:50 max:200                      # Show transactions between $50 and $200
list type:debit cat:food                 # Show food expenses only
list type:debit from:2026-03-01 min:10   # Expenses from March, $10 and above
```

**Expected output:**
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ID     TYPE     DATE           AMOUNT  CATEGORY      DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  a7b2c3 DEBIT    2026-03-05     $15.50  food          Chicken rice at Clementi
  d4e5f6 CREDIT   2026-03-01   $3000.00  salary        March salary
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  📊 Total: 2 transaction(s) shown.
```

---

### 4.5 `sort` — Set Global Sort Order

Sets a **persistent** default sort order that is applied to all subsequent `list` and `summarize` output, until changed or reset.

**Syntax:**
```
sort [field] [direction]
sort reset
sort
```

**Options:**

| Usage              | Effect                                          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `sort`             | Displays the current global sort setting         |
| `sort amount`      | Sort by amount, ascending (default direction)    |
| `sort amount desc` | Sort by amount, descending                       |
| `sort date`        | Sort by date, ascending                          |
| `sort date desc`   | Sort by date, newest first                       |
| `sort reset`       | Clear the global sort; revert to insertion order |

**Examples:**
```
sort amount          # Cheapest transactions first
sort date desc       # Most recent transactions first
sort reset           # Back to insertion order
sort                 # Check what the current sort is
```

> **Note:** The sort setting persists across the session but does not persist after `exit`. Reapply it on next launch if needed.

---

### 4.6 `summarize` — Financial Summary

Displays total credits, total debits, net balance, and a breakdown of spending by category. Accepts the same filter flags as `list`.

**Syntax:**
```
summarize [filter:value ...]
```

**Examples:**
```
summarize                               # Summary of all transactions
summarize type:debit                    # Summary of expenses only
summarize from:2026-01-01 to:2026-03-31 # Q1 2026 summary
summarize cat:food                      # Food category summary
```

**Expected output:**
```
===== Financial Summary =====
  Total Credit : $3000.00
  Total Debit  :   $15.50
  Net Balance  : $2984.50

--- Category Breakdown ---
  salary:            $3000.00
  food:              $15.50
=============================
```

---

### 4.7 `budget` — Budget Management

Manage monthly spending targets per category. Budget categories use fixed numeric codes (see [Section 6](#6-budget-categories)).

**Syntax:**
```
budget set    <YYYY-MM> <category_code> <amount>
budget view   [YYYY-MM]
budget edit   <YYYY-MM> <category_code> <amount>
budget delete <YYYY-MM> <category_code>
budget yearly [YYYY]
```

**Subcommands:**

| Subcommand | Description                                                              |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `set`      | Create a new monthly budget for a category                               |
| `view`     | Display budgets for a given month; if no month is given, shows all months|
| `edit`     | Update the amount for an existing budget entry                           |
| `delete`   | Remove a budget entry for a specific category and month                  |
| `yearly`   | Display a full-year budget summary (defaults to current year)            |

**Examples:**
```
budget set 2026-03 1 500        # Set a $500 food budget for March 2026
budget view 2026-03             # View all March 2026 budgets
budget edit 2026-03 1 600       # Increase the March food budget to $600
budget delete 2026-03 1         # Remove the March food budget
budget yearly 2026              # View all budgets across 2026
```

**Expected output for `budget view`:**
```
=== BUDGET SUMMARY FOR 2026-03 ===
Category                  |     Budget |      Spent |  Remaining | Progress
---------------------------+------------+------------+------------+----------------------
[1] Food                  | $  500.00 | $    0.00 | $  500.00 | ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   0%
---------------------------+------------+------------+------------+----------------------
Disposable Income         | $ 3500.00 | $    0.00 | $ 3500.00 | ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   0%
TOTAL                     | $ 4000.00 | $    0.00 | $ 4000.00 | ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   0%
```

> **Note:** *Disposable Income* is your total recorded credits minus all budget allocations for that month. A negative value means your allocated budgets exceed your recorded income.

---

### 4.8 `export` — Export to CSV

Exports all current transactions to a CSV file compatible with Excel and Google Sheets.

**Syntax:**
```
export [filename]
```

**Examples:**
```
export              # Creates transactions_YYYY-MM-DD.csv in the current directory
export backup.csv   # Creates backup.csv in the current directory
```

**Expected output:**
```
Exported 15 transactions to: ./transactions_2026-04-02.csv
```

**CSV structure:**
```
HashID,Type,Category,Amount,Date,Description
a7b2c3,credit,salary,3000.00,2026-03-01,March salary
d4e5f6,debit,food,15.50,2026-03-05,"Chicken rice at Clementi"
```

> **Tip:** Use `export` before any destructive operation (`clear`, `import` without `merge`) to preserve a backup of your data.

---

### 4.9 `import` — Import from CSV

Imports transactions from a CSV file. By default, all existing data is **replaced** by the imported data. Use the `merge` flag to add imported records to your existing transactions instead.

**Syntax:**
```
import <filename> [merge]
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter  | Required | Description                                                                    |
|------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `filename` | ✅ Yes    | Path to the CSV file (relative or absolute)                                    |
| `merge`    | ❌ No     | If specified, imported records are appended rather than replacing existing data |

**Examples:**
```
import backup.csv         # Replace all existing data with backup.csv
import backup.csv merge   # Add records from backup.csv to existing data
```

**Expected output:**
```
Import complete: 23 succeeded, 2 failed.
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Without `merge`, all existing transactions are **permanently deleted** before the import begins.

> **Note:** HashIDs are regenerated for all imported transactions to avoid ID collisions.

> **CSV format requirements:** Column headers must match exactly — `HashID,Type,Category,Amount,Date,Description`. Rows with invalid or missing fields are skipped with a warning.

---

### 4.10 `search` — Search Transactions

Searches all transactions for a keyword and displays every match. The search is case-insensitive and checks the description, category, HashID, and amount fields.

**Syntax:**
```
search <keyword>
```

**Examples:**
```
search chicken    # Find transactions whose description contains "chicken"
search food       # Find transactions in the food category
search 15.50      # Find transactions with amount 15.50
search a7b2c3     # Look up a transaction by HashID
```

**Expected output:**
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ID     TYPE     DATE           AMOUNT  CATEGORY      DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  a7b2c3 DEBIT    2026-03-05     $15.50  food          Chicken rice
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1 transaction(s) found for: "chicken"
```

> **Note:** `search` and `find` are aliases — both work identically.

---

### 4.11 `clear` — Clear All Data

Permanently deletes **all** transaction records. Budget definitions are **not** affected.

**Syntax:**
```
clear [--force]
```

**Behaviour:**

Without `--force`, RLAD prompts for confirmation:
```
WARNING: This will permanently delete all 47 transactions.
This action cannot be undone.
Type CONFIRM to proceed: CONFIRM
Cleared 47 transactions.
```

With `--force`, the confirmation step is skipped:
```
clear --force
Cleared 47 transactions.
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This action cannot be undone. Run `export` first to back up your data.

> **Note:** Budget entries and their category definitions are preserved after `clear`. Spending totals shown in `budget view` will reset to zero as there are no transactions to aggregate.

---

### 4.12 `help` — Get Help

Displays usage instructions. With no argument, lists all available commands. With a command name, shows detailed usage for that specific command.

**Syntax:**
```
help [command]
```

**Examples:**
```
help          # List all commands
help add      # Usage for the add command
help list     # Usage for the list command
help budget   # Usage for the budget command
```

---

### 4.13 `exit` — Exit RLAD

Saves all data and exits the application.

**Syntax:**
```
exit
```

---

## 5. Advanced Usage

### 5.1 Combined Filters

Multiple filters can be chained in a single `list` or `summarize` command. All conditions must be satisfied (logical AND).

```
list type:debit cat:food from:2026-03-01 to:2026-03-31 min:10
```

This returns all food expenses in March 2026 that are at least $10.

---

### 5.2 Relative Date Keywords

For `from:` and `to:` filters, you may use the following relative keywords instead of a full `YYYY-MM-DD` date:

| Keyword      | Resolves to                |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| `today`      | Today's date               |
| `yesterday`  | Yesterday's date           |
| `tomorrow`   | Tomorrow's date            |
| `this-week`  | Start of the current week  |
| `this-month` | Start of the current month |
| `last-month` | Start of the previous month|
| `last-year`  | Start of the previous year |

**Example:**
```
list from:this-month        # All transactions since the start of this month
list from:last-month to:this-month type:debit    # Last month's expenses
```

> **Note:** Relative date keywords are only valid for `from:` and `to:`. The `date` parameter in `add` and `modify` requires an exact `YYYY-MM-DD` value.

---

### 5.3 Multi-Category Filtering

To filter by more than one category simultaneously, provide a comma-separated list with no spaces.
The comma acts as **OR** — a transaction matches if its category is any one of the listed values.
This is different from combining separate filters (e.g. `type:debit cat:food`), where each filter uses AND logic.

```
list cat:food,transport             # Show food OR transport transactions
summarize cat:food,transport,health # Summary across three categories
```

> **Note:** `none` and `(none)` are reserved keywords. They cannot be used as category names when adding transactions, and using `cat:none` or `cat:(none)` in filters will show only transactions with no category assigned.

---

## 6. Budget Categories

The `budget` command uses fixed numeric category codes. Free-text category names (used in `add` and `list`) are a separate, independent system.

| Code | Category                       |
|------|--------------------------------|
| 1    | Food                           |
| 2    | Transport                      |
| 3    | Utilities                      |
| 4    | Housing                        |
| 5    | Health & Insurance             |
| 6    | Debt & Financial Obligations   |
| 7    | Child & Dependent Care         |
| 8    | Shopping & Personal Care       |
| 9    | Gifts & Donations              |
| 10   | Investments                    |
| 11   | Emergency Fund                 |
| 12   | Savings                        |

## 8. Data Persistence

RLAD automatically saves all transactions to a local file after every change. No manual save step is required.

| File              | Purpose                                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `data/rlad.txt`   | Primary data store — transactions               |
| `data/rlad_budget.csv` | Budget definitions and allocations          |

Your data is restored automatically the next time you launch RLAD from the same directory. Use `export` to create a portable CSV backup that can be opened in Excel or Google Sheets.

> **Note:** If `data/rlad.txt` is deleted or corrupted, RLAD will start with an empty state. Keep regular CSV exports as offsite backups.

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Mistakes

| Incorrect Command                            | Problem                                           | Correct Usage                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `add --amount 50`                            | Missing required parameters                       | `add debit 50 2026-03-05`                          |
| `add pizza 10 2026-03-05`                    | Invalid type value                                | `add debit 10 2026-03-05 food pizza`               |
| `list cat:salary food`                       | Space instead of comma for multiple categories    | `list cat:salary,food`                             |
| `delete a7b2c3 b8c9d0`                      | Only one HashID accepted per command              | Run `delete` twice                                 |
| `modify a7b2c3`                              | No fields to update specified                     | `modify a7b2c3 amount=25.00`                       |
| `add debit 15.50 2026-03-05 "Chicken rice"` | Description in position 4 (category position)     | `add debit 15.50 2026-03-05 food "Chicken rice"`   |

### Known Limitations

- **HashID lookup:** If you lose a HashID, use `list` to find it in the leftmost column.
- **Duplicate monthly budgets:** Each category supports at most one budget per month. Use `budget edit` to update an existing entry.

## 10. FAQ

**Q: What happens if I forget a transaction's HashID?**

Use `list` to retrieve it. The HashID is shown in the leftmost column of every transaction row.

---

**Q: Can I have multiple budgets for the same category in one month?**

No. Each category supports at most one budget per month. Use `budget edit` to update an existing entry rather than creating a new one.

---

**Q: What is "Disposable Income" in the budget view?**

It is the portion of your recorded credits for that month that has not been allocated to any budget category. A negative value means your total budget allocations exceed your recorded income for that month.

---

**Q: Can I import a CSV I edited in Excel?**

Yes. Ensure the first row contains the exact headers: `HashID,Type,Category,Amount,Date,Description`. Rows with missing or invalid fields are skipped with a warning.

---

**Q: Does RLAD save my data automatically?**

Yes. RLAD writes to `data/rlad.txt` after every modifying command. Your data is fully restored the next time you launch from the same directory.

---

**Q: What happens to my budgets when I use `clear`?**

Budget definitions and amounts are preserved. Only transaction data is deleted. Spending totals in `budget view` will show zero since there are no transactions to count against the budgets.

---

**Q: Can I name a category "none" or "(none)"?**

No. These are reserved keywords that represent transactions with no category. The application prevents you from creating a category with these names, and using `list cat:none` or `list cat:(none)` will show only transactions that have no category assigned.

---

**Q: I launched RLAD from a different directory and my data is gone.**

RLAD loads `data/rlad.txt` relative to the directory you launch it from. Always run `java -jar RLAD.jar` from the same working directory, or use `export` to maintain portable CSV backups.
